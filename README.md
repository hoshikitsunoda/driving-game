# driving-game
A web app for people who want to play a philosophical driving game.

Are the obstacles really the obstacles or your mind is creating it?<br />
Is it always good to beat it?<br />
If you try to reach it, you will never reach it.<br />
Maybe the best thing is just sit still and wait for things to resolve by itself.<br />
